# GamesServerJavaProject

This project is an interactive game server, and consists of three parts. 
It is all written in **Java** and includes a **server side** and a **client side** with a graphical interface. 
The server allows the client to play two games: **Tic Tac Toe** and **Catch The Bunny**. 
In addition, it's **multithreaded**, it allows you to play several games at the same time. 
To allow the addition of more games very easily I used **Strategy Pattern**.
